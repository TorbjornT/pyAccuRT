## AccuRT configuration file for ice material ##

# Ice inclusions (brine pockets and air bubbles) are assumed  
# to consist of a collection of homogeneous spheres with a 
# single-mode log-normal volume size distribution with a 
# specified volume mode radius (also called the mean radius  
# below) and width. The refractive index is based on the 
# compilation by Warren and Brandt (2008). 
# Two options are available: (i) a fast parameterization 
# based on Mie computations (default), and (ii) a complete  
# Mie computation. Additional absorption is introduced by 
# adding impurities. 

# See end of the main configuration file for documentation on
# how to tabulate data.

# NOTES: This ice material shall be included at the top of
# the lower slab and listed first in the tag, for example
# MATERIALS_INCLUDED_LOWER_SLAB = ice pure_water
# so that it controls the spectral variation of the refractive 
# index of the lower slab. The geometrical thickness of the 
# ice is an important parameter, which is controlled in the  
# main configuration file by the LAYER_DEPTHS_LOWER_SLAB tag. 
# All layer geometrical thicknesses are described by the 
# two LAYER_DEPTHS tags in the main configuration file.

#------------------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration options:
#------------------------------------------------------------------

# The PROFILE_LABEL tag shall be assigned <layer_numbering> or 
# <depth_numbering> depending on whether to use layer numbering 
# (counting downward from the top-of-the-lower-slab (TLS)) or  
# depths in meters (measured downward from the TLS) in the 
# BRINE_PROFILE, BUBBLE_PROFILE, or IMPURITY_PROFILE tags 
# defined below. The layer numbering is explained in detail 
# in the main configuration file below the default values 
# for the LAYER_DEPTHS_UPPER_SLAB tag. 
# For example, suppose we wish layers 1 and 2 (counting 
# downward from the TLS) to contain ice of thickness 0.25 
# in each layer with brine volume fractions of 0.05 in 
# layer 1 and 0.01 in layer 2. Then if layer boundaries of 
# 0.25 and 0.5 have been added to the default layer settings 
# in the main configuration file by setting 
# LAYER_DEPTHS_LOWER_SLAB = 0.25 0.5 100, we should specify 
# the two uppermost layers in the lower slab as follows:
# PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering
# BRINE_PROFILE  = 1 0.05
#                  2 0.01

PROFILE_LABEL = layer_numbering

# The BRINE_PROFILE tag shall be assigned the volume fraction of 
# brines pockets [unitless] versus depth [m], measured downward 
# from the TLS, or layer number, counting downward from the TLS. 
# A single value will give a constant volume fraction with depth.

BRINE_PROFILE  = 1 0.05
                 2 0.01

# The BUBBLE_PROFILE tag shall be assigned the volume fraction of 
# bubbles [unitless] versus depth [m], measured downward from the 
# TLS, or layer number, counting downward from the TLS. A single 
# value will give a constant volume fraction with depth.

BUBBLE_PROFILE = 1 0.01
                 2 0.005

# The BRINE_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS tag shall be assigned brine effective 
# radius [microns] versus depth [m] measured downward from the TLS 
# or layer number, counting downward from the TLS. A single value 
# will give a constant radius with depth.

BRINE_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS = 1 100
                         2 150

# The BUBBLE_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS tag shall be assigned bubble effective
# radius [microns] versus depth [m] measured downward from the TLOS 
# or layer number, counting downward from the TLS. A single value 
# will give a constant radius with depth.

BUBBLE_EFFECTIVE_RADIUS = 1 100
                          2 200

# The IMPURITY_PROFILE tag shall be assigned tabulated ice impurity
# fractions [unitless] versus depth [m] measured from downward the 
# TLS or layer number, counting downward from the TOS. The 
# IMPURITY_PROFILE is the volume fraction of the ice impurities. 
# A single value will give a constant impurity fraction width with 
# depth.
   
IMPURITY_PROFILE = 1 1e-8
                   2 1e-7

# The IMPURITY_IMAG tag should be assigned the imaginary part of
# the impurity refractive index [unitless] versus wavelength [nm]. 
# A single value will give a constant index with wavelength.

IMPURITY_IMAG = 0.4

# The INTERNAL_MIXING tag shall be set to <true> or <false> depending
# on whether the ice impurities should be distributed inside or
# outside brines and bubbles, respectively. The surrounding ice will
# always have external impurity mixing.

INTERNAL_MIXING = $INTERNAL_MIXING

# The USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE tag shall be set to 
# <true> or <false> depending on whether the Heyney-Greenstein
# (HG) phase function will be used instead of the full Mie phase 
# function. If the tag is set to <true>, the asymmetry factor 
# of the HG phase function will be set equal to the first moment 
# of the Mie phase function, and the HG phase function will be used.

USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE = $USE_HG_PHASE_FUNCTION_OVERRIDE

# The USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE tag shall be assigned <true> or
# <false> depending on whether to use the parameterizations
# of the inherent optical properties described in Stamnes
# et al. JQSRT 2011, or a complete Mie code. Note that the
# parameterized version uses a Henyey-Greenstein phase function.
  
USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = $USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE

# The BRINE_SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH tag shall be assigned 
# tabulated brine size distribution widths [unitless] versus 
# depth [m] measured from the TLS or layer number, counting 
# from the TLS. A size distribution width is defined as the 
# standard deviation sigma of the log transformed size 
# distribution. A single value will give a constant width 
# with depth. 
# This width is irrelevant if USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = true.
# If USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = false, then the mode radius 
# r_{n} (in number density space) of the lognormal size 
# distribution will be calculated from the effective grain radius 
# using the relationship: r_{n} = r_{eff} exp{-2.5 sigma^2}, 
# between the effective grain radius r_{eff} and the mode 
# radius r_{n} (see Eq. (25) in Technical notes).

# tabulated bubble size distribution widths [unitless] versus 
# depth [m] measured from the TLS or layer number, counting 
# from the TLS. The size distribution width is defined as the 
# standard deviation sigma of the log transformed size 
# distribution. A single value will give a constant width 
# with depth. 
# This width is irrelevant if USE_PARAMETERIZED_MIE_CODE = true.

# radius r_{n} (see Eq. (25) in Technical notes).

$BUBBLE_SIZE_DISTRIBUTION_WIDTH

# The QUADRATURE_POINTS tag shall be assigned the number of
# quadrature points to be used in the numerical integration of 
# absorption and scattering coefficients over the particle size 
# distribution.
# The number of quadrature points should be an integer greater
# than 1, and should be set high enough to yield an accurate
# answer, but not too high to waste computer time.
# It is not recommended to use less than 50 quadrature points.
# This tag is only used when USE_PARAMETRIZED_MIE_CODE = false
